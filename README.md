🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project builds a Machine Learning classification model to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical diagnostic features. The goal is to assist in early detection using data-driven analysis and predictive modeling techniques.

🎯 Problem Statement

To develop a predictive model that classifies patients as diabetic or non-diabetic using key health indicators such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, insulin, age, and pregnancy count.

📊 Dataset

The project uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains medical records of female patients.

Target Variable:

0 → Non-Diabetic

1 → Diabetic

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Google Colab

🔍 Project Workflow

Data Loading and Inspection

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis

Feature Scaling

Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

📈 Results

The trained model achieved strong predictive performance on the test dataset. The evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in identifying diabetes risk based on medical features.
